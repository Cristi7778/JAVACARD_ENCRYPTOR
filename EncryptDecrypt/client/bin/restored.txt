                         MRS BENNET
          My dear Mr Bennet, have you heard that
          Netherfield Park is let at last?
	   (Pause.)
          		    MRS BENNET
          Do you not want to know who has taken it?

                         MR BENNET
          As you wish to tell me, I doubt I have
          any choice in the matterâ€¦
          (Lydia and Kitty listening behind the door.)

			    LYDIA
                         (TO ELIZABETH)
          Do you hear this? A Mr Bingley, a young man
          from the North of England, has come down
          on Monday in a chaise and four.

                         KITTY
          With five thousand a year!
          (Jane and Elizabeth joins them at the door.)

                         JANE
          Goodness!

                         LYDIA
          - and he's single to be sure.
          (Mr Bennet is trying to ignore Mrs Bennet.)

                         MRS BENNET
          What a fine thing for our girls!

                         MR BENNET
          How can it affect them?

                         MRS BENNET
          My dear Mr Bennet, how can you be so
          tiresome! You know that he must marry one
          of them.

                         MR BENNET
          Oh, so that is his design in settling
          here?
          (Mr Bennet takes a book from his table and walks out of
          the library into the corridor where the girls are
          gathered, Mrs Bennet following.)

                         MRS BENNET
          So you must go and visit him at once.

                         LYDIA
          Oh, yes, Papa.

                         KITTY
          Please, Papa!

                         MR BENNET
          There is no need, for I already have.
          (The piano stops. A frozen silence. They all stare.)

                         MRS BENNET
          You have?

                         JANE
          When?

                         MRS BENNET
          How can you tease me, Mr Bennet. You have
          no compassion for my poor nerves?

                         MR BENNET
          You mistake me, my dear. I have a high
          respect for them. They are my constant
          companions these twenty years.

                         MRS BENNET
          Is he amiable?

                         KITTY
          Is he handsome?

                         LYDIA
          He's sure to be handsome.

                         ELIZABETH
                         (IRONICALLY)
          With five thousand a year, it would not
          matter if he had a big pink face.

                         MR BENNET
          I will give my hearty consent to his
          marrying whichever of the girls he
          chooses.

                         LYDIA
          So will he come to the ball tomorrow?

                         MR BENNET
          I believe so.
          (Lydia and Kitty shriek with excitement.)


                         KITTY
                         (TO JANE)
          I have to have your spotted muslin, please!

                         LYDIA
          I need it!

                         KITTY
          - if you do, I'll lend you my green
          slippers.
          (Mr Bennet winks at Elizabeth and turns to Mary, a
          serious, somewhat pedantic young woman.)

                         MR BENNET
          And what do you say, Mary? Are you not
          excited by the prospect of a ball?

                         MARY
          Society has claims on us all, Papa. As
          long as I have my mornings to myself, I
          consider an interval of recreation and
          amusement as quite desirable.
          (Elizabeth laughs.)

          2)MERRYTON BALL

                         LYDIA
          (fussing over her dress)
          I literally can't breathe its so tight.

                         KITTY
          My toes hurt.
          (Elizabeth and Jane are a little apart from their family.)

                         ELIZABETH
          Well, if every man in this room does not
          end the evening completely in love with
          you then I am no judge of beauty.

                         JANE
          Or men.

                         ELIZABETH
          Oh, they are far too easy to judge.

                         JANE
          They are not all bad.

                         ELIZABETH
          Humourless poppycocks, in my limited
          experience.

                         JANE
          One of these days, Lizzie, someone will
          catch your eye and then you'll have to
          watch your tongue.

                         ELIZABETH
	   And eat my hat. 
(She stops speaking. And stares. A dazzling group enters the room: George Bingley, his sister Caroline, and Darcy. Darcy surveys the hall. He catches Elizabeth's eye. She   stares, with a kind of surprise shock. Jane notices and looks at Darcy. He turns away.)

                         JANE
          Luckily, you are not wearing a hat.
          
                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
          We are a long way from Grosvenor Square,
          are we not, Mr Darcy?
         (Mr Bingley spots Jane Bennet. For a moment he forgets
          himself and openly looks at her.)

                         MR BINGLEY
          I find it very charming.

                         CAROLINE BINGLEY
                         (TO DARCY)
          My brother is so easily pleased, is he
          not?
         
          (Elizabeth has found her great friend Charlotte Lucas - an
          intelligent, sensible woman in her late twenties. They
          spy through the crowd.)

                         ELIZABETH
          So which of the painted peacocks is our
          Mr Bingley?

                         CHARLOTTE
          He is on the right, and on the left is
          his sister.

                         ELIZABETH
          And the person with the disagreeable
          expression?

                         CHARLOTTE
          That is his good friend, Mr Darcy.

                         ELIZABETH
          Poor soul.

                         CHARLOTTE
          On the contrary, he has ten thousand a
          year and owns half of Derbyshire.
          
	   (Sir William Lucas takes it upon himself to
          introduce Mr Bingley and Mr Darcy to his daughter
          Charlotte and the Bennet family.)

                         SIR WILLIAM
          My eldest daughter you know, Mrs
          Bennet ...miss Jane Bennet, Elizabeth and
          Miss Mary Bennet.

                         MRS BENNET
          It is a pleasure. I have two others but
          they are already dancing.

                         MR BINGLEY
          Delighted to make your acquaintance.

                         SIR WILLIAM
          And may I introduce Mr Darcy.
          -- of Pemberley, in Derbyshire!
          (A stiff bow from Darcy,Elizabeth smiles, Darcy does not.)

                         ELIZABETH
          How do you like it here in Hertfordshire,
          Mr Bingley?

                         MR BINGLEY
          (smiling at Jane shyly)
          Very much.

                         ELIZABETH
          The library at Netherfield, I've heard,
          is one of the finest in the country.

                         MR BINGLEY
          Yes, it fills me with guilt.
	   Not a good reader, you see. I like being
          out of doors. I mean, I can read, of course.

                         MISS BINGLEY
          Your library at Pemberly, Mr Darcy, is
          astonishingly good.

                         DARCY
          Thank you. It is the work of many
          generations.

                         MISS BINGLEY
          And then you have added so much to it
          yourself.

                         JANE
          I wish I read more, but there always
          seems so many other things to do.

                         BINGLEY
          That's exactly what I meant.

          (Mr and Mrs Bennet stand a little apart from Elizabeth and
          the other young people. Lydia and Kitty bound up to them
          in a state of high excitement.)

                         LYDIA
          Mama! The regiment is arriving next week!

                         KITTY
          And will be here for the whole winter!
          Mrs Forster told us!

                         LYDIA
          They're going to be stationed in the
          village!

          (Mr Bingley turns to Jane.)

                         MR BINGLEY
          May I have the honour?
          (They leave to dance.)

                         ELIZABETH
          Do you dance Mr Darcy?

                         DARCY
          Not if I can help it.
          (Elizabeth, Darcy and Miss Bingley stand in silence as
          they overhear the following...)

                         LYDIA
          Officers! Lots of officers!

                         KITTY
          How will we meet them?

                         LYDIA
          It's easy. You just walk up and down in
          front of them and drop something.
          (Lydia pantomimes the actions for Kitty.)
	   They pick it up. You say 'oh thank you
          sir' and blush prettily and then you're
          introduced!

                         MR BENNET
          I have long suspected that we have two of
          the silliest girls in the county.

                         MRS BENNET
          Oh Mr Bennet! I remember the time when I
          liked a red coat myself, and if a smart
          young colonel with six thousand a year
          should want one of my girls I shall not
          say nay to him.
          (Mr Darcy overhears this. Profoundly embarrassed, Lizzie
          moves away.)
             
          (Mr Bingley is dancing with Jane. Mrs Bennet,
          with a group of other mothers, watches the young couple
          with rather too obvious satisfaction.)

                         MRS BENNET
          That dress becomes her, does it not. 
          Though of course my Jane needs little
          help from couturiers.
          (Elizabeth wanders through the throng. She looks at
          Bingley and Jane ending the dance.)

          (Darcy is joined by Bingley exhilarated by the dance.)

                         BINGLEY
          Come Darcy, I must have you dance. I hate
          to see you standing by yourself in this
          stupid manner.

                         MR DARCY
          You know how I detest it.

                         MR BINGLEY
          Upon my word, I've never seen so many
          pretty girls in my life.

                         DARCY
          You are dancing with the only handsome
          girl in the room.

                         BINGLEY
          Oh, she is the most beautiful creature I
          ever beheld, but her sister Elizabeth is
          very agreeable.
          (They have stopped at the edge of the dance floor and have
          not seen Elizabeth and Charlotte who are standing close
          behind them. Elizabeth smirks as she overhears their
          conversation.)

                         DARCY
          Perfectly tolerable, I dare say, but not
          handsome enough to tempt me.
          You had better return to your partner and
          enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting
          your time with me.
          (Bingley goes off.)

          (Elizabeth and Charlotte, who have overheard Darcy and
          Bingley's exchange.)

                         CHARLOTTE
          Ignore him, Lizzie, he is such a
          disagreeable man it would be a misfortune
          to be liked by him.

                         ELIZABETH
          Don't worry. I would not dance with him
          for half of Derbyshire.
