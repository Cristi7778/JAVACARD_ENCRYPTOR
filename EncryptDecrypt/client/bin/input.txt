 The terms unconscious, nonconscious, and
 subconscious can all be used to describe the absence
 of awareness or thought. Even in academic circles,
 these words are often used interchangeably without
 much nitpicking (for once). Nonconscious is the term
 I’m going to use because it is broad enough to
 encompass both the processes of the mind we could
 never consciously access and the moments when we
 are simply not paying attention to what surrounds
 us. Nonconscious is a description of anything you are
 not consciously thinking about.
* Certainly, there are some aspects of your identity
 that tend to remain unchanged over time—like
 identifying as someone who is tall or short. But even
 for more fixed qualities and characteristics, whether
 you view them in a positive or negative light is
 determined by your experiences throughout life.
* Readers of The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg
 will recognize these terms. Duhigg wrote a great
 book and my intention is to pick up where he left off
 by integrating these stages into four simple laws you
 can apply to build better habits in life and work.
* Charles Duhigg and Nir Eyal deserve special
 recognition for their influence on this image. This
 representation of the habit loop is a combination of
 language that was popularized by Duhigg’s book,
 The Power of Habit, and a design that was
 popularized by Eyal’s book, Hooked.
* When I visited Japan, I saw this strategy save a
 woman’s life. Her young son stepped onto the
 Shinkansen, one of Japan’s famous bullet trains that
 travel at over two hundred miles per hour, just as the
 doors were closing. She was left outside on the
 platform and jammed her arm through the door to
 grab him. With her arm stuck in the door, the train
 was about to take off, but right before it pulled away
 an employee performed a safety check by Pointing
and-Calling up and down the platform. In less than
 f
 ive seconds, he noticed the woman and managed to
 stop the train from leaving. The door opened, the
 woman—now in tears—ran to her son, and a minute
 later the train departed safely.
